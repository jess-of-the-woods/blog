    Chapter 5
    <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
    <p>I found this chapter really interesting and hopefully I can put some of what I learnt into practice in my life. It was a lot about how to deal with emotions, particularly negative or distressing emotions and triggers. There was an mnemonic in the chapter based on an acronym called 'SiBerian North Rail Road', which stands for 'Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect and Respond'. Its about teaching a new way of dealing with negative emotions and increasing your ability to self-regulate the emotional parts of your brain by giving you some tools to take a breath, and just stop before you throw yourself into whatever automatic response you might have. Or in other situations, to avoid throwing yourself into a cascade of negative self-reinforcing emotions.</p>
    <p>The other thing which stood out to me was the idea of not feeding the monsters.. in terms of when an emotion like anger arises, to not feed it by continually focussing on the thing that has made you angry, whether that is a person or a situation. This links back to an earlier part of the chapter talking about aversion and grasping. The author talks about aversion & grasping as two sides of the same coin. Aversion being your emotional reaction to a stimulus/situation where you wish it would leave/leave you alone. And grasping as the desire you have for a positive experience/emotion to never leave or end. If you can reduce your own aversion/grasping and just let things come as they will and not try to push them away or stop them from leaving but just let them exist this will end a great deal of our suffering. Thich Nhat Hanh put it this way "wilting flowers do not cause suffering; it is the unrealistic desire that flowers not wilt that causes suffering".</p>
    <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
    <p>I did two and a half minutes of meditation for this task. I had a lot of different thoughts and feelings come up. Some worry about how much time has passed and about all the other assignments I still need to complete this week. And briefly wondering how much time I had left to meditate during. But also I felt calm and relaxed. And then afterwards feeling quite happy, and more relaxed and focussed in general than beforehand.</p>
