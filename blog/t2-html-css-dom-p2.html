    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
    <p>Grid based design is using a grid for laying out a page. Based on rules about how peoples eyes tend to navigate around a page, it makes it easier to find important information. And easier for the designer to have a structure.</p>
    <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
    <p>Responsive design is design which will work on a variety of devices of different screen sizes. The layout will dynamically adjust to look good no matter what size the browser window (or device screen) is.</p>
    <h3>Semantic structure</h3>
    <p>Semantic structure is using tags which indicate the type of content to be found within them. Using tags like header, footer, nav, p, h1, etc. will allow a person using a screen reader to more easily parse the page, therefore increasing the accessibility of the web.</p>
