    <p>Search Inside Yourself, Chapter 8</p>
    <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
    <p>I don't really have much experience of leadership, whether compassion or not. </p>
    <h4>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
    <p>I tried this meditation and it was good, although I think just taking time out of your day to meditate is just usually good, no matter the type of meditation. I did find it a bit difficult visualising taking in goodness and multiplying it.. Its kind of hard to imagine how to do that. I did like the focus on compassion and how meditating on compassion & desiring to end suffering can nurture that quality in yourself.</p>
    <h4>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h4>
    <p>I don't feel like I am in a good space in my life to be able to do this meditation as it involves taking in the badness & suffering in the world and transforming it. The instructions in the book for this exercise advised on doing it when in a space where you feel able to deal with this stuff & at the moment I just don't feel able. </p>
    <h4>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h4>
    <p>The SCARF model for the Social Brain stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, Fairness. These are primary domains of social experience which the brain treats as rewards or threats. The model comes from the book 'Your Brain at Work' by David Rock.</p>
    <p>Some of these domains I can see how they apply to my experience of bootcamp. Things such as certainty. Being uncertain whether I am doing the right course of study. Being unsure if I have what it takes to complete the course. And its quite a scary thing to have that uncertainty and also to just keep on working as if it will all turn out ok. A desire for more autonomy in my life is one reason why I am wanting to become a web developer. To have more ability to determine my income, and more freedom in general through having more options which more income can provide.</p>
    <h4>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</h4>
    <p>I have had a somewhat tricky conversation on facebook in the last couple of days. I only just read the section in the chapter regarding this after sending a reply to one of my friends, so I'm kind of thinking about it in retrospect. I'm still waiting to hear if she will reply to me, but my response to her original request was something I put a lot of thought into. As well as consulting with a couple of people I trust and who are close to me.</p>
    <p>The situation is as follows. My friend Agnes (not her real name) started a facebook group in 2012. Some time after that she made me admin and left the group. Since then she had a falling out with another one of my friends Bartholomew (again, not their real name), who is now co-admin with me. Agnes re-joined the group & Agnes messaged me requesting to be re-added as admin to the group which she created. I felt that this wouldn't be a good idea as Agnes & Bartholomew don't get on, and I felt there was a risk of a 'coup' happening if I were to acquiesce to Agnes' request. I consulted with Hetty & Bartholomew for advice on how to respond to Agnes. After writing a response and getting feedback and rewriting again, I sent the message to Agnes. I tried to make it as friendly as possible without coming across all fake. </p>
    <p>I have been feeling very unsettled since this whole situation has come up. And feeling a lot of stress and anxiety and nausea. I am worried about losing my friendship with Agnes who I like. And find the process of trying to find a balance between friends who have had a falling out to be very stressful and uncertain. So far it is still unresolved.</p>
