<!--     <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
    <p></p> -->
    <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
    <p>I haven't done this in a formal way but have practised it informally for a while. And I think it is a powerful technique. It can create closeness & trust between people quickly.</p>
    <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
    <p>I enjoyed this exercise. Its something I would like to create / train to be a habit which I do daily, in every conversation & interaction I have.</p>
    <!-- <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing</h4>
    <p></p> -->
    <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
    <p>The three assumptions I thought were really cool. They are as follows: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Assume that everybody in this room is here to serve the greater good, until proven otherwise.</li>
      <li>Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that none of us has any hidden agenda, until proven otherwise.</li>
      <li>Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that we are all reasonable even when we disagree, until proven otherwise.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These seem to me like things which would be useful in a variety of contexts beyond just meetings as suggested in the book. And kind of made me realise that sometimes I am quite cynical and assume the worst about people and their intentions, until proven otherwise. And this is something that I would like to reduce.</p>
