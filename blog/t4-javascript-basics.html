      <h4>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
      <p>Javascript is another level of complexity above HTML & CSS. While HTML & CSS implement the content of a webpage, things like the text, links to images, font, layout etc., javascript adds interesting functionality to a page. This often makes pages interactive. Where elements on the page will respond to user actions such as moving a mouse cursor over, or clicking. </p>
      <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>
      <p>Control Flow is a term which describes the sequence of actions, and branchings of actions that a program will take as it runs. Loops are a part of this control flow, such that a certain thing happens several times and then it is finished. It is necessary to define conditions for loops to end, otherwise they will continue forever and crash your computer. An analogy of a loop from everyday life would be making toast. You start off putting your toast in the toaster and check it every now and then to see whether it is done. If it is still not toasted enough then we put it down again for more time. Otherwise if it is toasted enough then we take it out of the toaster and the loop ends.</p>
      <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
      <p>Arrays are variables indexed by number, so we access them by using the name of the variable and the index number which references the position of the element inside the variable that we want. For example if we have an array of footwear like footwear["boots", "sneakers", "sandals"], then we would access sneakers by footwear[1] as array indexes always start from 0.</p>
      <p>Objects are somewhat more complex. They can contain objects inside themselves, known as nested objects. They can also contain arrays, strings, integers & booleans. An important thing to know about accessing data from an object is that data is stored as key-value pairs, such as 'height: 30'. So if we have an object called desk, we access the data within using the name of the object and then the name of the key, so 'desk.height'.</p>
      <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>
      <p>A function is basically a section of code which does something useful. We define functions in our code, giving them a name and the word function and then the 'guts' of the function go inside curly braces. Having done so we can now call the function just by using its name, elsewhere in our program. This way we define the function once, then it can be called and used multiple times within our program without having to write out the same lines of code over and over. </p>
