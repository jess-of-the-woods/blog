    <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
    <p>Reading through the process over product article/concept made me feel a bit more relaxed about my wonky looking site (Its less wonky looking now :) ). It made me take a pause and think about the process I should be following, including referencing my wireframe drawings and using dev tools to make minor adjustments to my site before making the changes in the CSS itself. This last thing, using dev tools, whether in chrome or firefox, is something that I need to remember to do in future as it can really speed up the process. One doesn't waste time digging through the CSS trying to find what selector is causing some element to do what its doing. And sometimes feeling like you have a lot redundancy/or excess in the CSS. I feel like I have just got my head around the DOM a bit better and how to use that knowledge to tweak my site.</p>
    <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
    <p>As I mentioned in my last <a href="c2-emotional-intelligence.html">Cultural Blog</a>, I had read some of the 'Search Inside Yourself' book previously, including chapter 2, so it wasn't so much that my idea of what meditation is has changed. Although I did find it really interesting to re-read it. I guess I have for some years been quite interested in meditation as its benefits seem quite varied, esp. things like calmness, clarity and happiness. Its something that I think would be really beneficial to my life if I could find a way to include it in my routine. Being able to deal with difficult times in life with a bit more equanimity.</p>
    <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
    <p>I found it fascinating to learn about how meditation can help to boost your immune system. And that meditation can increase your ability to pay attention for a longer period of time.</p>
    <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
    <p>The fact that just creating an intention is a form of meditation. And that even just doing that can have effects. And that the process of bringing your attention back to your breath, again and again, is like flexing the muscles of your mind and will make it easier to do this in future. I really like the ideas in the section about how to deal with distractions during meditation. Acknowledge that something is happening, Experience without judging, If you need to react, to maintain mindfulness. And finally letting it go, inviting something gently to leave. But if it 'decides' on staying then thats ok too.</p>
