    <p>1 December 2015</p>
    <p>My first reflection. I guess at the moment I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by how much I don't know, esp. on the technical side of things. I have so many questions. And so much to remember. And lots of questions around how much I should be reaching out to others in my cohort or the teachers for answers or how much I should be doing my own research to solve problems.</p>
  
    <p>A lot of the stuff which I have learnt around the culture of <a href="http://devacademy.co.nz" target="_blank">Enspiral Dev Academy</a>/<a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> I really like. Things like having a culture of respect and kindness. Valuing vulnerablity, although I'm not sure I'm great at that, I like it theoretically. And trying to be holistic in approach. Encouraging people to bring their whole selves into this. I guess I am used to taking part in somewhat radical/activist social spaces and some stuff around being mindful of speech and how you interact with others has become kinda just second nature. So I'm happy to see that this stuff is also a part of the culture of EDA. </p>
  
    <p>I think my expectations so far of the course are pretty much matching up to how it is going. Its a bit to get used to learning new tools. Toggl and how exactly I oughta track my time/tasks. And waffle boards/tickets though I imagine this stuff will get easier. </p>
