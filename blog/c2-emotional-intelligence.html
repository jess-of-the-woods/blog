    <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
    <p>I had read some of 'Search Inside Yourself' including chapter 1 a few months ago but one thing that stood out for me after reading through it again was the idea of increasing the space between stimulus and response. For some reason that it something which seems quite concrete and something I can relate to and hold on to.</p>
    <p>Also the idea of mindfulness of your body. In terms of 'getting more bang for your buck' from your mindfulness practice. Gaining high resolution awareness. Mindfulness is something which I'd like to find a way of including in my daily routine. Even if it is only 2 minutes I think it would be a big help in dealing with difficult things in life.</p>
    <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
    <p>I found the mindfulness practice good. I felt more relaxed afterwards. It was pretty easy being such a short time. But it made me aware of all the chatter and noise in my mind. </p>
