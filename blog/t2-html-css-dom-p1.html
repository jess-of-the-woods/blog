    <h3>Some designs and structural features I liked from CSS Zen Garden and others, and would like to implement in future.</h3>
    <p>Transparency / overlays.. <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/180/">Vertigo</a></p>
    <p>Reflowable / Flexbox content</p>
    <p>Transition / Gradations in color</p>
    <p>Animations</p>
    <p>I like how the header image fades out at the bottom. And the fuzzy borders/repeating parts of an image of the main content text box <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/171/" target="_blank">Shaolin Yokobue</a></p>
    <h3>A non-technical analogy of HTML, CSS & The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
    <p>I would say HTML is like the walls or structure of the house, the CSS is what determines the color, wallpaper, curtains etc. And the DOM is what it all looks like when complete, including dynamically generated elements like lighting, smoke effects etc. </p>
    <h3>Boxifying Design</h3>
    <p>Boxifying Design is where you look at a design mockup (pdf/jpg etc.) and then draw boxes around the different elements as a precursor and as an aid to creating it in html as an actual page.</p>
    <h3>The Box Model</h3>
    <p>The box model is a term used in the context of HTML/CSS in terms of layout. It is the idea that every element in a page is a box and each box has several items. These items are, from the outside in, the margin, the border, the padding and the content. The content is in the very middle surrounded by the other elements in concentric boxes.</p>
