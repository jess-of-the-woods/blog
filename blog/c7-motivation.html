    <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
    <p>I think that this is quite a healthy way of thinking about happiness in our lives. To reverse the order in which we usually seek to attain happiness. To put our purpose first and to seek to achieve that. </p>
    <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,</h4>
    <h5>What are your core values?</h5>
    <p>I think that most of my core values really cluster around the concept of justice. A desire to see justice in the world (or an end to injustice, being another way of looking at it). Other things I wrote about were wanting to see an end to gross inequality and ecological devastation. And an end to hierarchical forms of organising. Standing up to injustice, marginalisation and oppression. Also compassion and kindness have always been values that are close to my heart.</p>
    <h5>What do you stand for?</h5>
    <p>I would like to think that I stand in some small way for those who are marginalised. To amplify the voices of those who are marginalised and oppressed. To refuse, wherever I can to be complicit in perpetuating injustice, oppression and violence.</p>
    <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
    <p>I like the stuff the book says about cultivating resilience. Especially as it relates to failure and our ability to cope with that. That 99% of success is actually failure, and that those who do succeed in life have dealt with (and have the resilience, whether emotional or cognitive to deal with) failure.</p>
    <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
    <p>I've found this blog post quite difficult as I'm finding it quite hard to really connect my core values in life to the course of study I'm pursuing. So in terms of the most sustainable form of happiness coming from working towards a purpose which is greater than oneself, I don't really know how to envision that for my life. I struggle to understand how I can use web development in a way to work for justice and equality, although I imagine this will be a slow process of finding ways of applying my skills in certain ways. Part of wanting to do this is a way out escaping from poverty for myself and having some autonomy and options. And I really struggle sometimes with feeling like this is a selfish way to live. Although it brings to mind something a friend of mine once said to me. I don't remember the exact words but it was about as you raise yourself up, make sure to raise everyone else around you up at the same time. And if this is something I can do then I think I can live with that.</p>
