    <h4>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</h4>
    <p>A responsive site is one which is designed to work well and be usable on a wide range of devices, from smartphones to tablets to laptops to desktop computers with large screens. Responsive design is very important nowadays as a large percentage of those who access the internet only use mobile devices, or devices other than laptop or desktop computers which have for sometime been considered as the default. If a site is not responsive then it is likely that there will be less traffic from mobile users which are a significant percentage of users who might use the site.</p>
    <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</h4>
    <p>Mobile first design is implementing design with mobile users in mind right from the start. Designing so that the layout and size of elements on the page will be appropriately displayed on mobile devices first, then considering the display requirements of larger devices secondary. This works by applying new display/layout rules as screen widths increase, rather than the inverse, thereby not forcing smaller (typically less powerful) devices to process code which is not applicable to them.</p>
