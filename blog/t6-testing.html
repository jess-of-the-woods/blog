    <h4>In the javascript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</h4>
    <h4>parentheses ( )</h4>
    <p>Parentheses are used in several different ways in javaScript. They are used when defining functions, they surround any arguments the function will take. These 'arguments' are inputs which will be transformed in some way by the function.</p>
    <p>Another way they are used is when calling functions. Basically this means using or invoking the instructions you have written in the function. So if you have a function called 'multiply', you would called it with <span class="bold">multiply()</span>, passing in any arguments within the parentheses, in this case a number to be multiplied.<br><br>See also the section on braces below for usage of parentheses in loops & conditional statements.</p>
    <h4>brackets [ ]</h4>
    <p>Square brackets are used to contain arrays. You can define an empty array like so.. <span class="bold">var newArray = []</span>. Or you could define an array containing elements with <span class="bold">var newArray = [23, 50, "Hi there"]</span></p>
    <p>Another place where square brackets are used is when accessing object properties with bracket notation. If I have an object called 'bedroom' which has a property of 'bed', then I can access this bed property by <span class="bold">bedroom["bed"]</span></p>
    <h4>braces { }</h4>
    <p>Braces or curly braces are used in functions to contain the code which is the body of a function. They also can define objects eg. <span class="bold">var myObject = {"hair": "grey"}</span></p>
    <p>They are also used to contain the body of loops, such as 'for' loops or 'while' loops. And also 'if' statements/conditionals. Typically a if statement is written like so. <span class="bold">if (newArray > 0) {<br>
    do something<br>}</span><br>In this instance, the parentheses surround the condition which if it evaluates to true, then the code in the curly braces will execute.</p>
    <h4>single quotes ' '</h4>
    <p>Single quotes can be used to surround strings or array elements.</p>
    <h4>double quotes " "</h4>
    <p>Double quotes can be used to surround strings or array elements and in some cases are preferable to single quotes. If the string you are surrounding itself contains single quotes, for example the string <span class="bold">"I said to her 'Catch ya later', then I left"</span>, if these are surrounded by single quotes it can mean that the program doesn't get interpreted properly and the interpreter will not understand which part is a string.</p>
