    <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
    <p>The book suggests that they are basically the same thing. And that being the case, means that mindfulness being a trainable skill means that sefl-awareness is also.</p>
    <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
    <p>I tried the Body Scan practice. I felt a lot of different things throughout the 6 minutes I meditated for. I noticed a decent amount of tension in my body. I noticed that my breathing is very restrained. </p>
    <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h4>
    <p>I found this chapter really interesting. In the past I think I had been aware of the idea of thoughts being a thing separate from one's 'self' and of contemplating that through meditation. Of letting them come & go as they will. But I don't think its really something I had considered as far as emotions.</p>
    <p>Also the way that language is so connected to the ways we think in terms of how we describe our emotional states.. i.e. "I am happy" as opposed to "I feel anger". How that kind of feeds into us feeling like that emotion is an integral part of yourself. The book uses the metaphor of clouds in the sky to illustrate the distinctiveness. The clouds are the emotions & thoughts and the sky is our mind.</p>
