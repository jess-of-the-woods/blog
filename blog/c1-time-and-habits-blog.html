      <h1>C1 Time and Habits Blog</h1>
      <p>2 December 2015</p>
      <p>I really like the ideas in the talk by BJ Fogg around tiny habits. It seems like stuff that would make sense to chain things together in terms of using an existing behaviour as a trigger. Its definitely something I would like to experiment with in my life.</p> 

      <p>I found some of the ideas in the Counter-intuitive productivity article interesting. Around the fact that people are organic beings, not steady state machines and that sometimes we need to let ourselves do what we need/want to do. And that by giving ourselves that space then we can actually increase productivity in the end.</p>

      <p>The stuff around how to create a habit by Charles Duhigg & Ramit Sethi made a lot of sense. That you dont necessarily have to be excited or have any particular attitude towards creating a habit. But that attitude tends to follow behaviour, so if you just do a thing again & again, by whatever means you need to, then it will become a habit and you will see the positive effects of it and therefore your attitude will change.</p>

      <p>I haven't really tried many of these yet, with the exception of meditation, as I've only just read about them but I do plan on putting some into practise. Especially the pomodoro technique as it seems like a reasonably easy one. And makes a lot of sense. And also the stuff round tiny habits</p>
