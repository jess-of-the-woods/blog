      <p title="1st paragraph">I really like the ideas in the talk by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8" target ="_blank">BJ Fogg</a> around tiny habits. It seems like stuff that would make sense to chain things together in terms of using an existing behaviour as a trigger. Its definitely something I would like to experiment with in my life.</p> 


      <p>I found some of the ideas in the <a href="http://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/" target ="_blank">Counter-intuitive productivity article</a> interesting. Around the fact that people are organic beings, not steady state machines and that sometimes we need to let ourselves do what we need/want to do. And that by giving ourselves that space then we can actually increase productivity in the end.</p>

      <p>The stuff around how to create a habit by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8XG02das-A" target ="_blank">Charles Duhigg & Ramit Sethi</a> made a lot of sense. That you dont necessarily have to be excited or have any particular attitude towards creating a habit. But that attitude tends to follow behaviour, so if you just do a thing again & again, by whatever means you need to, then it will become a habit and you will see the positive effects of it and therefore your attitude will change.</p>

      <p>I haven't really tried many of these yet, with the exception of meditation, as I've only just read about them but I do plan on putting some into practise. Especially the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">pomodoro technique</a> as it seems like a reasonably easy one. And makes a lot of sense. And also the stuff round tiny habits</p>
