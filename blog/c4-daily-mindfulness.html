    <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
    <p>I learnt that it can be difficult to remember a lot of smaller details around my partners monologue. Although in the looping stage, she told me that I had summed it up well, just omitted a few small, but significant details. I feel that I started off dipping and having some awareness of my own feelings during, though I think that decreased towards the end of the time. During my own monologue it was nice to have someone's undivided attention. And it felt slightly amusing to have that space and to be able to do anything with it/ go in any direction with how I recounted the conversation with my friend earlier that day.</p>
    <p>My conversation partner found it interesting that because I was recalling a conversation I'd had earlier that day, that there was a pause at the start as I attempted to recall. Also she said that during the section where she was listening, her attention started to wander at one point as she started to think about something I said. Though she brought her attention back.</p>
    <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
    <p>I would really like to have a buddy to practise mindfulness meditation with, although I think that could be difficult to find. I think that the other two are things I'd like to implement though.. Doing less than I can, and taking one mindful breath each day. Especially the latter as that seems to me the easiest suggestion of the three and is something I try to do already when I remember to.</p>
